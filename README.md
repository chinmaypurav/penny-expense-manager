[![Project Status: In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-In%20Development-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/chinmaypurav/penny-expense-manager)

⚠️ **This project is currently in active development. 
Things may be unstable and breaking changes can occur frequently.**

Penny Expense Manager is built around the idea of an expense tracker for a family.
When living as a family,
you would want
to track all your family incomes and expenses at a single place with an option
to view at individual level or at a group level.

The application is using [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) at its core.

## Installation
