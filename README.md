# Penny Expense Manager

Penny Expense Manager is built around the idea of an expense tracker for a family.
When living as a family,
you would want
to track all your family incomes and expenses at a single place with an option
to view at individual level or at a group level.

The application is using [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) at its core.

## Installation
